Custom Filter
=============

This project demonstrates creating of a Custom Filter control 
for RadGridView from Telerik Silverlight UI Controls.

### Structure of Custom Filter

The custom filter uses the RadTreeView control to create a tree based filter.
This can be modified to use any other control of your choice.

As required, the custom filter derives from IFilteringControl. It uses the MVVM architecture
for its design.
